# Film Library

### About
Film Library is the first project I built in a node.js framework. It allows users to query the OMDB film API, create a move favorites
list, and engage in online discussion about films with others. You can visit the site at: http://filmlibrary.herokuapp.com. A quick note:
the site uses movie poster images from the OMDB API. Because of usage rules, these images are not consistenly available to developers.

### Technologies

As noted, Film Library was built in a node.js framework, and utilizes npm modules including ejs, express, body-parser, and sequelize. It also utilizes
the OMDB API.
